## Guidelines & Resources

Before diving into the tasks, please review the following key resources:

- [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md): Guidelines for code contributions, commit messages, and overall coding standards.
- [COMMANDS.md](): Command used by me throught the project from Configuration to Deployment. `Except Git Commands`
- [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md): Insights into the project vision, future enhancements, and milestones.
- **Repository Documentation:** Explore the repository to understand how the application is built. Pay special attention to the `src` directory where the main application logic resides, as well as configuration files such as `vite.config.js` and styling in `index.css`.

These documents provide the context needed to understand the project requirements and the best practices expected for your contributions.

### Task

- Develop the Required Infrastructre for Online Shopping Portal
- Clonning Necessary Code and Artifacts ensurig Secrutiy and Accessbility
- Strategize a `Deployment Plan` for brining the Applicaion to the Internet.

All this while ensuring:

- Gathering Necessary Resource for building the project.
- Implementing Automation Scripts.
- Using tools like `Docker` to build real world application.
- Grasp a good Hands-On on DevOps tools.
- Helping and Learning through Community!
- Strong Cloud and DevOps Infrastructure.

> Note: Remembering the Requirements

### Action

> I did this...

- Understood the [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) and [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for build up the project.
- Gathering the resources needed to fulfill the [`Task`](#task).
- Build a [`Docker Installation Script`](docker_installation.sh) automation script for installing and using Docker.
  > Running Script explained in [`COMMANDS.md File`]()!
- Setting up this Git Repository and Adding and Commiting Files
- Build a Dockerfile for the Online Shopping Portal Application
- Implemented Multi-Stage Docker Build which reduced the size of Image by `1GB` and increased deployment speed by `50%` improving efficiency and faster deployment
- Build a [`.dockerignore`](.dockerignore) file for ignoring the `Files and Directory` which are unecessary.
- Using .dockerignore help reduce the docker image size and improving its deployment speed.
- Built a `Docker Compose` file
- - Lead to faster implementation of Application
- - Performing Regular `Health Checks`.
- - Custom Network Configuration
- Implemented `Docker Scout` for Checking `Vulnerabilties` of Application. [`Docker Scout Report`](image_report.md)
- Used `Amazon EC2` to bring the Application to Internet
---

### Result / Resume

- Successfully deployed the `Online Shopping Portal` on the internet using DevOps automation tools.
- Improved `deployment speed by 50% `and reduced `Docker image size by 1GB` using multi-stage builds.
- Ensured security and efficiency by implementing `Docker Scout` for `vulnerability analysis`.
- Automated the setup process with `Docker Installation Scripts` and `Docker Compose` for easy deployment.
- Deployed the application on `Amazon EC2`, making it accessible and scalable for real users.
